These tutorials take a practical coding-based approach, and the best way to learn the material is to execute the code and experiment with the examples. Check out the full series here: \n\n1. [First Steps with Python and Jupyter](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/first-steps-with-python)\n2. [A Quick Tour of Variables and Data Types](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-variables-and-data-types)\n3. [Branching using Conditional Statements and Loops](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-branching-and-loops)\n4.

[Object Oriented Programming with Classes](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-object-oriented-programming)\n\n\nThe following topics are covered in this tutorial:\n\n* Performing arithmetic operations using Python\n* Solving multi-step problems using variables\n* Evaluating conditions using Python\n* Combining conditions with logical operators\n* Adding text styles using Markdown"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How to run the code\n\nThis tutorial is an executable [*Jupyter notebook*](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml), a platform for sharing data science projects online (don't worry if these terms seem unfamiliar, we'll learn more about them soon). You can \"run\" this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your own computer*.\n\n### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n\n\n### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run this notebook on your computer locally, you'll need to set up Python and download the notebook. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) distribution of Python. Here's what you need to do to get started:\n\n1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Make sure to add Conda binaries to your system `PATH` to be able to run the `conda` command line tool from your Mac/Linux terminal or Windows command prompt. \n\n\n2. Create and activate a [Conda virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) called `zerotopandas` which you can use for this tutorial series, by running the follwing commands on your terminal / command prompt:\n```\nconda create -n intro-to-python -y python=3.8 \nconda activate intro-to-python\n```\nYou'll need to create the environment only once, but you'll have to activate it every time want to run the notebook. When the environment is activated, you should be able to see a prefix `(intro-to-python)` within your terminal or command prompt.\n\n\n3. Install the required Python libraries within the environment by the running the following command:\n```\npip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn --upgrade\n```\n\n4. Download the notebook for this tutorial using the `jovian clone` command:\n```\njovian clone aakashns/first-steps-with-python\n```\nThe notebook is downloaded to the directory `first-steps-with-python`. You can also use the \"Download Zip\" option on the page instead of using the `jovian clone` command.\n\n\n5. Enter the project directory and start the Jupyter notebook:\n```\ncd first-steps-with-python\njupyter notebook\n```\n\n6. You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser. Click on the notebook `first-steps-with-python.ipynb` to open it and run the code. If you want to type out the code yourself, you can also create a new notebook using the \"New\" button.\n\n>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of \"cells\", which can contain explanations in text or code written in Python. Code cells can be executed and their outputs e.g. numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files etc. can be viewed within the notebook, which makes it a really powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't afraid to experiment with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encoutering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top of the notebook."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Performing Arithmetic Operations using Python\n\nLet's begin by using Python as a calculator. You can write and execute Python using a code cell within Jupyter. \n\n> **Working with Cells**: To create a new cell within Jupyter, you can select \"Insert > Insert Cell Below\" from the menu bar or just press the \"+\" button on the toolbar. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Esc+B` to create a new cell. Once a cell is created, click on it to select it. You can then change the cell type to code or markdown (text) using \"Cell > Cell Type\" menu option. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts `Esc+Y` and `Esc+M`. Double click a cell to edit the content within the cell. To apply your changes and run a cell, use the \"Cell > Run Cells\" menu option or click the \"Run\" button on the toolbar or just use the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Enter`. You can see a full list of keyboard shortcuts using the \"Help > Keyboard Shortcuts\" menu option.\n\nRun the code cells below to perform calculations and view their result. Try changing the numbers and run the changed cells again to see updated results.

Double click on a text cell within Jupyter to edit it. In the edit mode, you'll notice that the text looks a little different (for instance the heading has a `##` prefix. This text is writted using Markdown, a simple way to add styles to your text. Execute this cell to see the output without the special characters. You can switch back and forth between the source and the output to see how to create a specific style.\n\nFor, instance, you can use one or more `#` characters at the start of a line to create headers of different sizes:\n\n# Header 1\n\n## Header 2\n\n### Header 3\n\n#### Header 4\n\nTo create a bulleted or numbered list, simply start a line with `*` or `1.`.\n\nA bulleted list:\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2\n* Item 3\n\nA numbered list:\n\n1. Apple\n2. Banana\n3. Pineapple\n\nYou can make some text bold using `**` e.g. **this is some bold text**, or make it italic using `*` e.g. *this is some italic text.* You can also create links e.g. [this is a link](https://jovian.ml). Images are easily embedded too:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7ndD3nX.png)\n\nAnother really nice feature of Markdown is ability to include blocks of code. Note that code blocks inside Markdown cells cannot be executed.\n\n```\n# Perform the required calculations\nprofit_per_bag = cost_of_ice_bag * profit_margin\ntotal_profit = number_of_bags * profit_per_bag\n\n# Display the result\nprint(\"The grocery store makes a total profit of $\", total_profit)\n\n```\n\nYou can learn the full syntax of Markdown here: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Save and upload your notebook\n\nWhether you're running this Jupyter notebook on an online service like Binder or on your local machine, it's important to save your work from time, so that you can access it later, or share it online.
